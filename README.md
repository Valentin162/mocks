# mocks

This repository hosts projects in which I copy websites' designs. 

Mocks may not necessarily be 100% the same as the original, especially as I may prefer to implement something in a different manner.

DevTools is used only to get things like color values and for precision (e.g. to get the exact margin correct), but is otherwise not assumed

Since the goal is to just copy the design, some functionalities and accessibility features may not be reproduced
